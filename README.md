## Sports Data Library

Welcome to my Sports Data Library — a centralized, organized collection of datasets compiled for research in Sports Economics. This repository contains structured data for various professional and collegiate sports, intended for use in academic, analytical, and modeling projects.

The datasets here are compiled and cleaned to facilitate reproducible research, especially in areas such as player performance, team dynamics, financial outcomes, and policy analysis across leagues and organizations.

## Current Data Collections

- [NFL](https://github.com/jameskemper/sports_data_library/tree/main/NFL)
- [NCAA_football](https://github.com/jameskemper/sports_data_library/tree/master/NCAA_football)
- [MNCAA_bball](https://github.com/jameskemper/sports_data_library/tree/main/MNCAA_bball)
- [NBA](https://github.com/jameskemper/sports_data_library/tree/main/NBA)

## Notes

- More folders and datasets will be added as research evolves.
- Data sources are a mix of public APIs, scraped records, and manually collected historical records.
- Each folder may contain its own README to explain file structure, variable definitions, and data provenance.

Feel free to fork, cite, or use for your own analysis — and stay tuned for updates as more sports and questions are added to the library.
